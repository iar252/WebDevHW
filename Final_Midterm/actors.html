		<p> Amitabh and Jaya Bachchan, basically the iconic mother and father of Bollywood. Catch them playing the parent role in any movie. What's more iconic than that? <i>When they play both parents in a movie. </i> I didn't get to watch movies of when they plays the main characters when they were younger, but I bet they were amazing. I've only ever seen then play the parent. I've seen Amitabh play so many different types of fathers, ranging from strict and controlling to a player who gets more women than his son. As far as I can recall, Jaya has always been the mother who children could always turn to for emotional support. The fact that they're both married in real life really just makes the whole thing a million times better. </p>

		<p>As you can tell from my reviews, I'm pretty in love with SRK. He's done such beautiful work. When his character cries, there's no way the viewer isn't crying alongside him. His dialogue is amazing, and I get that the writers write it, but he really brings the words to life. Its probably his uniquely shaped eyebrows that do the trick. I'm glad he's been successfully entertaining us since such a young age. I feel almost priviliged to say that I've seen most of his classic movies. I cannot bring myself to actually accept that he's 51 years old now. HOW? Where did the time go??? Why can't he be young forever and ever? The funniest thing is that his wife's parents didn't want him to marry their daughter because he was a struggling artist back then. Little did they know she'd be marrying the King of Bollywood. :')  Also, his precious life loving tweets just make your day a bit brighter. Like his personality is really great off camera too?? Bless. </p>

		<p>Kajol is straight up iconic. People definitely knew her because of her eyebrows. (Who else had unique eyebrows? SRK. I'm started to see a trend amongst our talented actors..). But anyway, Kajol has those lovestruck eyes and playful personality that fits with all her characters. She'll win over the guy in the movie while winning over the audience as well. She's done so many movies with SRK that people have been shipping them since day one. If I didn't know about SRK's magical love story with his wife, I'd ship this one too. But anyway Kajol will always be remembered for her talent and I'm really sad she doesn't make as many movies as before. She was the queen of the 1990s and early 200s. </p>

	<br>
		<p>Saif Ali Khan almost always played the character that was playful or the younger brother that was mischievous. He played those roles the best because it fits his real life personality so well. He's probably my second favorite OG Khan of Bollywood. The movies he had with Rani Mukerjee worked out great, as the two worked well together. As a kid, I could always count on him to make sappy romantic movies funny.  </p>

	<br>
		<p>Aishwarya is known for her beauty. I remember as a kid whenever someone would say "Indians are ugly" you could always count on someone pulling up a picture of Aishwarya and saying "YOU THOUGHT WRONG". I'm just trying to figure out how she manages to look so young at this age?? What's her secret because please spill. Her dance skills were amazing, and we all know Bollywood requires their actors to be dancers as well. After a certain one of her movies were released, you knew Desi girls at school talent shows would definitely dance to "Krazy ki are". Aishwarya also made the Bachchan family more legendary by marrying Jaya and Amitabh's son. Iconic family really. </p>

		<p>He was so cute when he was younger and so talented, but he decided muscles were important and worked out till he looked like a cloud. I'd be nicer about him if his personality wasn't so poopy. He's always had anger issues and after Aishwarya and he broke up, everyone found out more about his anger issues. People usually argue who the best Khan is, and the conversations get heavy when it comes down to SRK and Salman. Let me just say, Salman Khan is my least favorite, regardless of how talented of an actor he was.  </p>

		<p> A real life queen. She danced the best classical dances for her roles. Her dance in Devdas will never be forgotten. In general she played the sweetheart girl who put men in their places when they were rude. Her eyes are full of kindness and youth, which is probably her secret to still looking so young and beautiful. She doesn't act as much as she did before, but she still holds great friendships with the other classic actors and its wonderful. </p>

		<p>Also my second favorite OG Khan of Bollywood. Almost all his movies held a greater meaning than just your typical love story where either side of the couple's parents did not accept their love. His movie topics ranged from British colonization of India to avenging murder. He also spent his time being an activist. In 2001, he was appointed national brand ambassador of UNICEF to promote child nutrition. Just a few days ago, SRK surprised Aamir with a visit for his birthday. Two great Khans biffles? Im here for it. </p>

		<p>Rani repping Bengla speakers in Bollywood. When I learned she spoke Bangla, my heart sanggg. She always acted so well, I really loved watching her romantic movies growing up. She played the sweetheart and the smartmouth roles so well. Haven't seen her active in Bollywood for a while and I miss her. </p>

		<p>One of the best dancers of Bollywood. The way he moved literally looked like he was flying in the wind. I love the story behind why he became an actor too. He had a sixth finger and wanted money to remove it surgically, so he went into acting. And somehow became everyone's favorite heartthrob. </p>

		<p>She's really a new actress, not a classical actress I watched growing up but I love her so much that I felt the need to include her here. She got recognition for acting very quickly because honestly shes just that good. She's also spoken up about mental health problems which has impacted many of her fans. It's great to see actors use their platform to bring light to certain issues. Deepika has also acted in a film in Hollywood, this time with Van Diesel for Return of Xander Cage. </p>
